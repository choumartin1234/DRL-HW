Setup

Note: Please be sure you have Python 3.6.x installed on your system. The following instructions should work on Mac or Linux. If you have any trouble getting set up, please come to office hours and the TAs will be happy to help.

[Optional] virtual environment: Once you have unzipped the starter code, you might want to create a virtual environment for the project. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed on your machine. To set up a virtual environment, run the following:

	cd assignment1
	sudo pip install virtualenv      # This may already be installed
	virtualenv .env                  # Create a virtual environment
	source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment
	pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies

# Work on the assignment for a while ...

	deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment


Install requirements (without a virtual environment): To install the required packages locally without setting up a virtual environment, run the following:

	cd assignment1
	pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
